## We need to analyze key indicators for our sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1.	Total Revenue = The sum of the total price/sales of all the pizza orders
2.	Average Order Value = The average amount spent per order ie, Total Revenue/total number of Orders.
3.	Total Pizzas sold = The sum of all the quantity of all the pizzas sold.
4.	Total Orders = The total number of orders placed.
5.	Average Pizzas per Order = Total number of Pizzas sold/ total number of Orders.
